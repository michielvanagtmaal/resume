        <h2>üòÉ About me</h2>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm a 20-year-old student living in the thriving city of Antwerp, Belgium. Interests of mine are branding, motion design, and you guessed it, UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for UX design started as a fun interest when I was around 14 years old. I came across a YouTube series where people could submit their work and get feedback from the host.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though 14 year old me didn‚Äôt have his own laptop, he still learnt a lot from just watching the series.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used Paint.NET on my parents‚Äô laptop to make my first designs. A couple years later, I finally got my own MacBook with Adobe XD and never stopped learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of right now, I am getting my bachelor‚Äôs degree in ‚Äòinteractive multimedia design‚Äô at Thomas More in Mechelen, Belgium. I will be graduating in February 2023.

                    <p>
                        Camprea builds an application for visitors and a dashboard for area operators that offer a very cost-effective solution to manage paid and free camper areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During these 3 months my tasks were user research, design research, design the entire application, design the entire dashboard and redesign their website. I‚Äôm also doing the branding for the company.

                    <p>
                        They allowed me to work from home but I went to the office once a week to know what it‚Äôs like to work at an office. We communicated in Dutch by using email, Whatsapp and Microsoft Teams.

                <h3>Freelancer @ Ebit - Motion Designer<h3>
                    <p>
                        A YouTuber named MattCS - with who I had worked with in the past - offered me to join the Ebit team as a motion designer. I didn‚Äôt have much to do during my summer holiday so I accepted the offer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ebit is an online cryptocurrency casino that is still in beta version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My task was to animate social media posts such as giveaways and announcements. I also had to animate a lot of advertisement banners to put on websites and stream overlays. Sometimes I received tasks that had to be done within a few hours, but that didn‚Äôt really bother me. I am stress-resistant and know how to work efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All the communication was in English using Discord and Notion. The Ukrainian graphic designer gave me Adobe Photoshop files for me to animate in Adobe After Effects.

                    <p>
                        I was really interested in web3 and wanted to get more into it so I thought the best way to learn is to be part of a community. In November 2021 I bought my first NFT. This Solana NFT was part of the FrogParty collection which was founded by a YouTuber I worked with in the past. I was really active in their Discord and learnt a lot about the space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
A couple months later the founder asked me to join their international, online team as a Motion Designer. I had to work together with a graphic designer from Ukraine and together we worked on social media posts. The designer gave me Adobe Photoshop and Figma files to animate in Adobe After Effects.

                    This school year was my third year studying ‚Äòinteractive multimedia design‚Äô so during this year I got a big assignment related to UX design.

                   <p>
                    I have learned a lot about UX design during this year because of my thesis ‚ÄòGruppo‚Äô, which you can find on my portfolio. At the end of the year, I had to present this project for recruiters so everything had to be perfect.
