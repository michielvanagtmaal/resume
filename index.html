        <h2>ðŸ˜ƒ About me</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m a 20-year-old student living in the thriving city of Antwerp, Belgium. Interests of mine are branding, motion design, and you guessed it, UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for UX design started as a fun interest when I was around 14 years old. I came across a YouTube series where people could submit their work and get feedback from the host.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though 14 year old me didnâ€™t have his own laptop, he still learnt a lot from just watching the series.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used Paint.NET on my parentsâ€™ laptop to make my first designs. A couple years later, I finally got my own MacBook with Adobe XD and never stopped learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of right now, I am getting my bachelorâ€™s degree in â€˜interactive multimedia designâ€™ at Thomas More in Mechelen, Belgium. I will be graduating in February 2023.
